Side quests have a way of adding fun and depth to life, even when they don’t directly align with your big goals. 

For me, I’ve had a few of these side quests over the years. Two of my longest ones are:

- Learning the guitar
- Mastering a new language

None of these are my “main quests,” but they keep me curious and engaged.

Interestingly, blogging started as a side quest earlier this year, and now it’s become something I really enjoy. 
It’s funny how something that starts off small can grow into something bigger over time.

Learning guitar, for instance, began with weekly lessons and slow progress. I’m not aiming to be a musician, but it’s a rewarding challenge.
I've been trying to get into fitness for a while now, it felt daunting at first, but over time, it's transforming into an important part of my routine.
And learning a new language? Well, I’m not fluent yet, but it’s great mental exercise, and who knows what doors it might open?

Much like in video games, side quests can serve as delightful diversions, but they also have the potential to evolve into something more.
Sometimes, they provide clarity for our next big move when the main path becomes unclear. I’ve found that side quests can even become subquests to a larger,
yet-to-be-realized goal. This is why it’s important to explore and nurture these pursuits, as they may lead to future opportunities or new directions we hadn’t anticipated.

So, while we often don’t start a side quest with the intention of it becoming the main quest, there’s always the potential for it to grow into something greater.
Side quests are not just hobbies—they're an integral part of life's unfolding journey.
