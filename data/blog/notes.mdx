## [Objects and Object Constructors:](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-objects-and-object-constructors)

1. **Object Literals**: 
   - Objects in JavaScript can be created using object literals, which is a straightforward way to group related data and functions.
   - Example: `const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };`.

2. **Dot and Bracket Notation**:
   - Access object properties using dot notation (`person.name`) or bracket notation (`person['name']`).
   - Bracket notation is useful when property names are dynamic or not valid identifiers.

3. **Object Constructors**:
   - Constructors are functions used to create multiple similar objects. They use the `new` keyword to instantiate objects.
   - Example: 
     ```javascript
     function Person(name, age) {
       this.name = name;
       this.age = age;
     }
     const john = new Person('John', 30);
     ```

4. **Prototypes**:
   - JavaScript objects have a prototype, which is another object from which they inherit properties and methods.
   - Methods defined on a constructorâ€™s prototype are shared across all instances created by that constructor.
   - Example: 
     ```javascript
     Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
       console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
     };
     ```

5. **Prototypal Inheritance**:
   - Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. This is the basis for prototypal inheritance in JavaScript, allowing for the creation of more complex object structures.

6. **Benefits of Constructors and Prototypes**:
   - Using constructors and prototypes helps to avoid redundancy, manage memory efficiently, and organize code better by separating concerns.
