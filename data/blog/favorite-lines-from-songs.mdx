## Billie Eilish:
- **"Never been the type to let someone see right through"** - i love you
- **"Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it"** - my strange addiction
- **"And it’s all I think about, when I’m behind the wheel. I worry this is how I’m always gonna feel. But nothing lasts. I know the deal."** - male fantasy
- **"Things I once enjoyed now just keep me employed. The things I'm longing for someday, I'll probably get bored of. It's so weird, that we care so much about things until we don't"** - getting older
- **"Next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughing, for anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine"** - getting older
