Hey there! I'm David! I'm a college student with an obsession with tech and a love for building things. I'm on a journey to find my so-and-so purpose, and exploring art, music, and design helps me connect the dots.

This little corner of the internet is where I share my current life journey, thoughts, and what I'm working on at the moment. 

This blog is my way of diving into writing. There's a lot of figuring out to do, but that's the exciting part, right?
